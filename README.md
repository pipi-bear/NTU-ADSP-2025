# Contents of this repo

This repository contains:
- homework file: subdirectory with prefix `HW`
- lecture notes (ppt given by the instructor with my written notes): subdirectory `Lecture_notes`

## HW

For the homework part, you can find a readme file (named `HW*_readme.md`) under each `HW` subdirectory, which contains information about:
- each file's usage
- score of this assignment

:warning: **IMPORTANT**: I really recommend reading these readme files (`HW*_readme.md`) since <ins>some files might be wrong, and are not included in the final handed in version !</ins>

## Lecture notes

In the `Lecture_notes` subdirectory, some pdf files are contained, they are the lecture ppts (version with written notes) by the professor, and my own notes added.

Also, you may find that my handwritings are hard to read :cry:  
I knew that so <ins>I changed into typing for most of the notes after p.121 of `ADSP_Write2`</ins>, so if you are frustrated recognizing the contents of my notes, you can start reading from here! 

### Two versions of ADSP_Write2.pdf

Note that for the file `ADSP_Write2.pdf`, there's two similar files:

- `ADSP_Write2.pdf`: p.81-151
- `ADSP_Write2_updated_version.pdf`: p.81-180

This is because originally I downloaded the older version of ADSP_Write2, so it only contains content from p.81 to p.151, and the newer version extends the content to p.180.

However, the notes for p.81-151 are already written in `ADSP_Write2.pdf`, so: 

$\rightarrow$ check `ADSP_Write2.pdf` if you need the notes for p.81-151   
$\rightarrow$ check `ADSP_Write2_updated_version.pdf` if you need the notes for p.152-180

### Two versions of ADSP_Write3.pdf

Similar to `ADSP_Write2.pdf`, I first wrote notes on the older version of lecture slides `ADSP_Write3.pdf`, which only contains pages p.181-195, so:

$\rightarrow$ check `ADSP_Write3.pdf` if you need the notes for p.181-195 
$\rightarrow$ check `ADSP_Write3_updated_version.pdf` if you need the notes for p.196-273
