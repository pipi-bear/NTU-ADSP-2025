# Contents of this repo

This repository contains:
- homework file: subdirectory with prefix `HW`
- lecture notes (ppt given by the instructor with my written notes): subdirectory `Lecture_notes`

## HW

For the homework part, you can find a readme file (named `HW*_readme.md`) under each `HW` subdirectory, which contains information about:
- each file's usage
- score of this assignment

:warning: **IMPORTANT**: I really recommend reading these readme files (`HW*_readme.md`) since some files might be wrong, and are not included in the final handed in version !

## Lecture notes

In the `Lecture_notes` subdirectory, some pdf files are contained, they are the lecture ppts (version with written notes) by the professor, and my own notes added.

### Two versions of ADSP_Write2.pdf

Note that for the file `ADSP_Write2.pdf`, there's two similar files:

- `ADSP_Write2.pdf`: p.81-151
- `ADSP_Write2_updated_version.pdf`: p.81-180

This is because originally I downloaded the older version of ADSP_Write2, so it only contains content from p.81 to p.151, and the newer version extends the content to p.180.

However, the notes for p.81-151 are already written in `ADSP_Write2.pdf`, so: 

$\rightarrow$ check `ADSP_Write2.pdf` if you need the notes for p.81-151   
$\rightarrow$ check `ADSP_Write2_updated_version.pdf` if you need the notes for p.152-180
