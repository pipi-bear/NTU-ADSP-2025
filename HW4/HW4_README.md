## Code for problem 1, 4, 7

In this HW, I wrote some code to solve problem 1, 4, 7. These code can be found at:

- code for prblem 1: `HW4/problem_1/prob_1.py`
- code for prblem 4: 
    - For subproblem (i): `HW4/4_arithmetic.py`
    - For subproblem (ii): `HW4/4_huffman.py`
- code for prblem 7: `HW4/7.py`

### Error and suggestion for problem 7

In this HW, I wrote a code to solve problem 7. The code can be found at: `HW4/7.py`

:warning: However, this code is wrong, and a modified version could be found in `HW5/4.py`. 
> $\rightarrow$ HW5's problem 4 has the same structure as this problem, and I placed the feedback in `HW5_README.md`, so you could check for **the values for the correct solution**, or modify my code `HW5/4.py` if you wish.
