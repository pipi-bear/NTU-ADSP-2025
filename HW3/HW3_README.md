# Contents of the Directory 

The directory HW3 contains:
- HW spec: `ADSP_HW3.pdf`
- HW spec (with little notes): `ADSP_HW3_notes.pdf`
- solution for ADSP_HW3: `ADSP_HW3_sol.pdf`, `ADSP_HW3_sol.tex`
> You can choose if you need the pdf veresion or the latex code (the equations can be copied)
 

## Problem 1

The subdirectory `prob_1` contains:
- the python file
- the generated .wav file
> You can modify the settings and run the script again, then the updated .wav file would be generated under the same directory where the script is in. 
- the piano sheet fragment for the song "YOASOBI-into the night"

Note that: 

:small_blue_diamond: I wrote this HW in a hurry, so I have no time to modify the AI generated `beat`, `score`, `octave` lists, so the .wav file may sound weird (which really does not sound like the original YOASOBI into the night :rofl:)

:white_check_mark: However, the functionalities are all fine, so you can just modify the lists and the variable vlaues (like `bpm`) to what you desired.

### Usage

Modify these lines to change the .wav file name and bpm:

```python
name = 'YOASOBI_into_the_night'
    
bpm = 160 
```

You can set your own score, beat, octave in the lists `score_ver1`, `beat_ver1`, `octaves_ver1`.
If you also have multiple versions or the above list names are modified, remember to make corresponding change in the following line:

```python
wav_file = getmusic(score_ver1, beat_ver1, name, octaves_ver1)
```

### Unused content

Originally I wanted to replace the contents generated by AI to my own, but then I found that I have no time to do all these stuff, so the `*ver2` lists are not used:

```python
    score_ver2 = [
        # First line
        5, 6.5, 
        1, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4, 1,
        6.5, 1, 5, 4, 3, 1, 3,
        4, 2, 5.5, 5, 5, 4, 2,
        2.5, 2, 6.5, 1, 6.5, 5, 6.5,

        # Second line
        1, 5.5, 5, 4, 2, 1, 6.5, 
        6.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 2.5,
        1, 3, 2, 5,
    ]

    """
    Some other content
    """

    ocataves_ver2 = [
        # First line
        5, 5, 
        6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6,
        5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5,
    ]
```

# Reference

## Problem 7 (c)

I don't think the answer of this subproblem ia covered in the lectures, so I searched for possible answers on the Internet.

The answers are referenced from a journal, which I downloaded and saved as `Digital_audio_compression.pdf`. It can be found under this `HW3` directory.
