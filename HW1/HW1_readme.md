# Contents of the Directory 

The directory HW1 contains:
- HW spec: `ADSP_HW1.pdf`
- HW spec (with little notes): `ADSP_HW1_write.pdf`
- solution for ADSP_HW1: `ADSP_HW1_sol.pdf`, `ADSP_HW1_sol.tex`
> You can choose if you need the pdf veresion or the latex code (the equations can be copied)

## Problem 1

For problem 1, we are asked to hand in the code and put the resulting images in the solution pdf (`ADSP_HW1_sol.pdf`). 

### images 

You can find the images that I attached in `ADSP_HW1_sol.pdf` by checking the subdirectory `prob1_img`.

### code

For the code part, note that:

:warning: <font color = "red">The matlab version (`HW1_prob1.m`) is wrong !!</font>
> I preserved it only because it's the original version that contains my thoughts

The final handed in file is the python version `HW1_prob.py`, which is also the code that generates the resulting images.

However, <ins>be cautious when using my code since I'm not pretty sure if it's right or not</ins>.
