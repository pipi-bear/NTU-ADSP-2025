# Contents of the Directory 

The directory HW2 contains:
- HW spec: `ADSP_HW2.pdf`
- HW spec (with little notes): `ADSP_HW2_write.pdf`
- solution for ADSP_HW2: `ADSP_HW2_sol.pdf`, `ADSP_HW2_sol.tex`
> You can choose if you need the pdf veresion or the latex code (the equations can be copied)
- problem 1 code: `HW2_prob1.py`
- problem 1 code result images: `prob1_iamges`

## Problem 1

For problem 1, we are asked to hand in the code and put the resulting images in the solution pdf (`ADSP_HW2_sol.pdf`). 

### images 

You can find the images that I attached in `ADSP_HW2_sol.pdf` by checking the subdirectory `prob1_images`.  

Note that there's two images:
- `required_plot.png`: the plot used in HW
- `plot_with_additional_info.png`: additional info that I printed to check if anything is wrong 

### Code

As mentioned above, some plotting parts are not required by the HW spec, if you do not need the additional plot, make sure you did not mistakenly copied from line 47 to 71:

```python
# Plotting additional information to check the result (r_1[n], r[n], h[n])

"""
<some plotting content>
"""

plt.tight_layout()
```

# Note

Some of the solutions in `ADSP_HW2_sol` mentioned that I've used the contents from ppt, like you may see "from ppt p.***".

The ppt resources can be found in the subdirectory `Lecture_notes`, you can download them if needed :)
